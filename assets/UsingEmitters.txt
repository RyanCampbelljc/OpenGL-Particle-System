Rules for spawn properties / affectors
1 Going to have no color.a but will have fade
2 Spawn property size is useless if you have scale affector
3 spawn property fade is useless if you have fade affector
4 Fade and color take all their values between 0,1


Note on points 2 and 3
Since size and fade need start and end values it seems to me
that keeping track of both their start value and current value 
for both properties in the particles struct would be too messy,
especially if more properties with a similar issue was added.
