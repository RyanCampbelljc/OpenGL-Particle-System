Rules/Notes for spawn properties / affectors
1 Going to have no color.a but will have fade
2 Fade and color take all their values between 0,1
3 A particle will hold its starting values and current values
for properties such as color, fade, scale. The affectors
can use this information to linear interpolate to an end value
that will be held in the affector. This allows easier fade in or out,
scale in or out in the same affector
