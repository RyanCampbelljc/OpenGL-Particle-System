<strong>Overview\</strong>
This project is an OpenGL-based particle system designed to simulate real-time particle effects like fire, smoke, water, or explosions. The particle effects can be customized in XML files to change properties such as color, blend mode, texture, duration, size, velocity, acceleration, lifetime, start position, spawn rate, pool size and scale. The particles come from a fixed size pool that is handled with a linked list. This improves rendering efficiency by limiting the number of particle objects created. Each particle emitter that makes up an effect, renders all particles in 1 draw call in order to improve efficiency.
