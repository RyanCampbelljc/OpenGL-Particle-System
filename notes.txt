Thoughts
should emitterfile reader just return a emitter obj instead of emitter class having to call emitterfilereader functions to get its info

emitter should use doubley linked list of particles
allocate array of particles not each on individually
use accumulator in emitter function

emitter
random or not burst time, burst or continuous
velocity,fade,color,size,rotation
this should increment particle age not the affectors	

slide 39. was the way to make it better by passing it an arry of particles





code plan
Effect class 
	Members
	Has a list of emitters
	Name
	Transform
	
	Functions
	start()
	stop()
	pause()
	update()
	render()
	setTransform()

Emitter
	Members
	List of inactive particle* (structs
	List of active particles.
	List of affectors it applies to its particles
	1 material
	SpawnLocationType (box,point etc)
	offset(from effect)
	Name
	NumParticles
	Duration
	Type(continuous,burst)
	RepeatingEvery->if burst
	Birthrate
	
	SpawnProperties
	color,size,vel,fade,lifetime members that are either constant or random
	
	
	Functions
	update()
	render()
	SpawnParticle()
	init()
	addToPool()
	getFreeParticle()


Class or struct for each affector as well
probably best to get particles rendering with initial starting values before planning any further
